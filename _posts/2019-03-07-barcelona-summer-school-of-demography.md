Here is you chance to cut in and dive into R. 

In July [BaRacelona Summer School of Demography][bssd] welcomes dedicated scholars, aspiring or established, to help them migrate to the world of new oppoRtunities. 

The school consists of 4 modules. You can take them all or choose specific ones. The first, instructed by [Tim Riffe][tim], introduces the basics of R. The second, instructed by [myself][ilya], focuses on visualizing data, very general with a slight tilt towards population data. The third, instructed by [Marie-Pier Bergeron Boucher][mariepier], presents the foundations of demographic analysis with R. Even if you are not (yet) a demographer these methods are very general and are usable in a wide range of social science disciplines. Finally, the fourth course, instructed by [Juan Galeano][juan], teaches the powerful ways to unleash the spatial dimension of data analysis. 

There are still several places available, the call  closes on March 31st.
