This week, the 30-th issue of my Demographic Digest [was published](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2017/0715/digest01.php).   

[Demographic Digest](/dd) is my project that started in November 2015. Twice a month I select fresh demographic papers and write brief summaries of them in Russian to be published in [Demoscope Weekly](http://demoscope.ru), the most popular Russian journal/website in social sciences. If you read Russian, you may want to browse [the archive](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/arc/arcdigest.php) or visit [the website](https://ikashnitsky.github.io/dem-digest/) of the project (which is still to be filled).  

The project is in the transitional phase now. Since 2016 Demographic Digest welcomes contributions from from external authors. In February 2017 I launched the [first iteration of a project](https://www.hse.ru/org/hse/pfair/199751652.html) for the students of National Research University Higher School of Economics.  

To draw a line after the first phase of the project, I analysed what journals supplied Demographic Digest most frequently. Also, my desire was to try visualizing data with treemaps, which I mentioned in the bonus part[^1] of [the latest digest issue](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2017/0715/digest03.php).  

For that, I exported the bibliographic data of all the papers covered in Demographic Digest. I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) as a reference manager; the paper records are exported as a single .bib file, which I then saved as a [plain text (.txt) file](/doc/misc/dd-stats/dd-bib.txt). Then I read this data in R, cleaned it, and finally visualized.


```
# load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(readxl)
library(extrafont)
myfont <- "Roboto Condensed"

df <- data.frame(lines = readLines("https://ikashnitsky.github.io/doc/misc/dd-stats/dd-bib.txt")) %>% 
        mutate(lines = lines %>% as.character()) %>% 
        
        # grab only the lines that contain journals' titles
        filter(lines %>% str_detect("journaltitle")) %>% 
        
        # remove everything that is not the bare journal's title
        transmute(journals = lines %>% 
                       str_replace_all(pattern = "\tjournaltitle = |\\Q{\\E|\\Q}\\E,|\\Q}\\E", 
                                       replacement = "")) %>% 
        # calculate frequencies
        group_by(journals) %>% 
        summarise(n = n())
```

For one journal title, Ageing and Society, I failed to replace the "\&" using [regular expressions](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf). This one is to be fixed manually. I also corrected the title of Lancet journal removing the article "The". Finally, I corrected the frequencies for Population Studies and Population and Development Review subtracting 6, because for both journals I provided lists of most cited papers as a bonus. Following the same logic, I cleaned the data from the papers that appeared in the bonus part. 

```
# correct "Ageing and Society"
df[1,1] <- "Ageing and Society"

# correct the title of Lancet
df <- df %>% mutate(journals = journals %>% str_replace("The Lancet", "Lancet"))

# correct "Population and Development Review" and "Population Studies" for 6 each
# Reason - top cited papers bonus
df[df$journals %in% c("Population and Development Review", "Population Studies"), 2] <- 
        df[df$journals %in% c("Population and Development Review", "Population Studies"), 2] - 6
```

To provide some additional metrics of the journals, I downloaded bibliometric data from the [SCImago Journal & Country Rank project]()http://www.scimagojr.com/aboutus.php. Demographic journals usually have rather low SJR, compared to medical journals; that's why I downloaded the data only for journals in [Social Sciences](http://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?area=3300) (the[.xlsx file](/doc/misc/dd-stats/scimagojr.xlsx)). Then I read the data in R and join to my data frame.

```
# read SJR data for journals in Social Sciences
sjr <- readxl::read_excel("https://ikashnitsky.github.io/doc/misc/dd-stats/scimagojr.xlsx", 1) %>% 
        mutate(id = Title %>% tolower())

# join the data frames; note that I create an "id" variable in lower case
df_sjr <- left_join(df %>% mutate(id = journals %>% tolower), sjr, "id") 
```

Finally, it's time to visualize the data. I use the amazing `treemap` package[^2].

```
# Treemap visualization
library(treemap)

treemap(dtf = df_sjr, 
        index = "journals", 
        vSize = "n", 
        vColor = "SJR", 
        type = "value",
        n = 5,
        palette = "BrBG", 
        border.col = "grey10", 
        title = "Journals' frequency in Demographic Digest",
        title.legend = "SJR (only social sciences)",
        fontfamily.title = myfont,
        fontfamily.labels = myfont,
        fontfamily.legend = myfont,
        drop.unused.levels = T)
```

## Here is how the output looks
[![treemap][f1]][f1]

Note that the lion's share of Population Studies is mainly explained by [the first issue of Demographic Digest](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2015/0661/digest01.php), in which I covered all the papers from the brilliant special issue [Population â€” The long view](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rpst20/69/sup1).

[^1]: I finish each issue of Demographic Digest with a bonus, in with I cover fun papers, discuss some academia related issues, or just provide link to cool visualizations and projects.
[^2]: I also tried `portfolio` and `treemapify`, but liked the output from `treemap` most.
