# Welcome to my website!

I am a demographer.

This site gives an overview of my academic activities.

I am a PhD fellow in demography at the [University of Groningen][1] and the [Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute][2]. My scientific advisors are [Leo van Wissen][3] and [Joop de Beer][4]. 

I also work as a Junior Research Fellow in the [Institute for Social Development Studies at the National Research University Higher School of Economics][5]. 

My research focuses on regional variations in aging across Europe,  the demographic processes shaping them, their dynamics and possible implications for economies and societies. My interests include most topics relating to demography, population geography, spatial analysis and data visualization.

I am an avid [R](https://cran.r-project.org) user, who loves GIS, spatial analysis, and fancy data visualizations. I am happy that [my blog](/) is included in the brilliant [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) project. My main interest is demography. I am trying to follow the state-of-the-art research in the field and write brief summaries (in Russian) of selected demographic papers in my [Demographic Digest](/dd).
